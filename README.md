## Hello! My name is Izzy Bedichek

## Interests
I am fascinated by how humans live and how we design our food and shelter systems. I would love to one day work in optimizing resource usage (e.g. space, energy, or water). Additionally, I love to write, and want to combine data science and science writing to improve the available knowledge base for those curious about machine learning.
